#  Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Description

Created a visualization dashboard website  with individual pages to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator by pulling data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities(Refer to Python API Repo https://github.com/Elisu87/Python-API-Challenge/blob/master/README.md). Factors looked included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity.
